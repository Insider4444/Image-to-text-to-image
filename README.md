# Image Encryption/Decryption Tool By 4444 & Cp6E

This is a command-line tool written in Python for encrypting and decrypting images using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. The tool uses the `Cryptodome` library for AES encryption and the `tqdm` library for progress bars.

## Features

- Encrypts an image file using a user-provided encryption key.
- Decrypts an encrypted image file using the correct encryption key.
- Displays progress bars during encryption and decryption.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x [Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Cryptodome library (`pip install pycryptodomex`)
- tqdm library (`pip install tqdm`)
- termcolor library (`pip install termcolor`)
- rich library (`pip install rich`)
- or Install All Requirements by Just Running (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine. by (`git clone https://github.com/Insider4444/Image-to-text-to-image`)
2. Navigate to the repository directory in your terminal or command prompt.by (`cd Image-to-text-to-image`)
3. Install the required libraries using the `requirements.txt` file: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the `Image-Encrypt-4444-v4.py` file: `python Image-Encrypt-4444-v4.py`.

## Code Explanation

The following is a brief explanation of the code:

- The `get_aes_key()` function prompts the user to enter an encryption key, which is used for both encryption and decryption.
- The `get_aes_key_bytes(key)` function converts the encryption key string to bytes and pads it to the required length for AES encryption.
- The `encrypt_image(filename, key)` function reads the image data from the specified file, encrypts it using AES encryption with a randomly generated initialization vector (IV), and saves the encrypted data to a text file with the same name as the original image file.
- The `decrypt_text(filename, key)` function reads the encrypted data from the specified text file, decrypts it using the correct encryption key and IV, and saves the decrypted data to a JPEG file with the same name as the original image file.
- The `display_menu()` function displays a simple menu for the user to choose between encrypting an image, decrypting an image, or exiting the tool.
- The `main()` function is the entry point for the program and handles user input to call the appropriate functions.
